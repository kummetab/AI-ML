# AI-ML - Lap time prediction in Karting Motorsport
In this project, we developed a machine learning model to predict how long it takes a go-kart driver to complete a lap, based on 15 measurable factors such as driver experience, kart power, track layout, and weather conditions. Using data from 10,000 real karting sessions, the model learns patterns that connect these inputs to lap times. The most accurate model, called a Tuned Support Vector Regressor, delivered highly precise predictionsâ€”typically within 5 seconds of the actual time. This helps racing teams in several ways: they can better adjust kart setups for different tracks, personalize driver training, and plan race-day strategies more effectively. Compared to traditional methods, machine learning is better at handling complex relationships between variables, making it ideal for dynamic environments like motorsport. This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can lead to more competitive performance and smarter decisions, even in high-speed, high-stakes settings like go-kart racing.
